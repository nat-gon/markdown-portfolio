My name is Natali and I am new to programming. This is a career that I feel *very* interested in. Although at first it is intimidating and confusing; I often think about the future and how **the performance of this class for me will affect my life** in the longrun. My goal is to ***work hard and study well*** to pass the exams I need to pass. I would love to work for a huge tech company. *My passion* is here and im ready to let it *bloom*.
